How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It allows me to see clearly the difference between the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I make mistake or wanted to know what I have done previously, it would be very easy to track back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Allows you to decide to commit whenever you made a logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They have different purposes, in version control systems like Git, multiple need to work together
    for the program to work. On the other hand, for Google Docs, you online need each file to produce one document.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to look at each commit in the history and use git diff to see the changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you'll always know that theres a safe working version that you have previously been working on.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to Git for version control over my LaTeX files and python scripts.
